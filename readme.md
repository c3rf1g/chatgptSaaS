### What is this?
This is a project in which I am implementing a service for creating template-trained telegram bots based on chatgpt technology

A video on the topic of this project will be created on the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL3em4n1pKwp1WRl8azEsvA) channel 

To run, you need access to the Database, the path to it is specified in the configuration file
